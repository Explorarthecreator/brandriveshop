## About Project

For test purposes, you can create an account for testing but due to no storage such account can only be used once.

password: password

There are several functionalities such as:
- Login
- Sign Up
- Logout 
- Auto logout
- Fetching dashboard data.

The UI library used is Shadcn and other dependencies like Rechart and React hook form. Iconsax and Lucide react for the fonts.
